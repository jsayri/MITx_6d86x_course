Discussion about seen and unseen data for data prediciton with features selection / transformation
https://datascience.stackexchange.com/questions/51744/difference-betwen-predicting-seen-and-unseen-data

conclusions:
- increase the number of features to better predict data will work until a point of overfiting (high variance in the model)
- unseen data can be better predicted when feature transformation techniques are used!
- generalization problem (too complex good for training (seen) bad for testing (unseen))
